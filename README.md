# Sample Generated SVG Pumpkins NFT Contract

Generate "random" on-chain SVG Pumpkin NFTs on Ethereum.
Sample SVG Pumpkin: https://codepen.io/schwartzschwartz/pen/oNWxgzX

Test it locally by running:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
```

This script will mint 4 sample NFTs and log each token uri. If you copy and paste this into a browser you can see the generated json data and grab the SVG.


Deploy to the Rinkeby testnet with:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
Make sure to update hardhat.config.js before deploying.
